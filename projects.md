Hi! I'm Sher Minn. During the day I'm front-end web developer. By night, I teach programming and make comics. I work mostly with JavaScript.

I am currently interested in generative art and tiling theory. In the past, I have explored WebRTC, data visualization, subway station data, and image processing.


## Projects

### __[How to Kopi](https://piratefsh.github.io/kopi-teh-namer/public/)__

A webapp to help you order coffee or tea in local Malaysian/Singaporean coffeshops. Built on ES6 JavaScript, React and Webpack.

### __[Motion Detection in the browser](https://github.com/piratefsh/js-motion-detector)__

A simple motion detection library in JavaScript that uses the computer's webcam. Vanilla JavaScript.


### __[NYC Subway Traffic Visualizer](http://piratefsh.github.io/mta-maps/public/)__

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York City releases the number of exits and entries at every subway station in the city. It was a lot of raw, dirty data and big numbers that don't mean a lot as is. I scrapped it, put it into a database, did some simple cleaning and visualized it all on a map.

I worked with ES6 Javascript, Leaflet/Mapbox, SASS and Webpack for this project.

### __[L-Systems Renderer](http://piratefsh.github.io/p5js-art/public/lsystems/)__

L-Systems is a system that allows us to draw complex and organic patterns out of simple rules. It can replicate plant growth patterns and popular recursive patterns such as the Koch snowflake and Dragon's curve. Check out the examples in my renderer.

Used ES6 JavaScript and p5.js for rendering.

Project built on Webpack.

### __[Foggy Window](http://piratefsh.github.io/foggy-window/public/)__

You know when you're behind a window on a cold day and it fogs up? Yeah, we're replicating that in your browser. So you can have a foggy window in your window.

Used ES6 JavaScript and canvas to simulate a foggy window with Gaussian blur. Implemented smooth line drawing from mouse and touch events.

Project built on Webpack.

### __[Set Solver](https://github.com/piratefsh/set-solver)__

Use OpenCV to detect Set game cards in an image and solve for possible sets.

How it works:

1. Given an image, identify cards
2. For each card, identify color, shape, texture and number of card
3. Find valid combinations of set cards

### __[Leaflet Geofencer](http://piratefsh.github.io/leaflet.geofencer)__

A library to draw polygons on maps. Good for geofencing purposes. <a href="https://github.com/piratefsh/leaflet.geofencer">Github repo</a>.

### __[Cafehop MY](http://cafehop.my)__

A project mapping cafes in Malaysia. Built on Angular and Bootstrap. <a href="https://github.com/CafehopMY/cafehopmy.github.io">Github repo</a>.

### __[Issue Scraper](https://github.com/piratefsh/exactedition-issue-scaper)__
