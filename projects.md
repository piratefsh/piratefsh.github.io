Hi! I'm Sher Minn. During the day I'm front-end web developer. By night, I tinker around with stuff with Python. I've worked at various startups and freelance projects in industries ranging from jobs portals to payment solutions working mostly with AngularJS and a focus on UI/UX design.

I've been exploring WebRTC, data visualization, subway station data, and image processing. My first language was Java but I am now mostly bilingual in Javascript and Python. Sometimes I solve [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) challenges.

I also enjoy teaching coding, sci-fi and surrealist novels, running, and art!


## Projects

###__[NYC Subway Traffic Visualizer](http://piratefsh.github.io/mta-maps/public/)__

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York City releases the number of exits and entries at every subway station in the city. It was a lot of raw, dirty data and big numbers that don't mean a lot as is. I scrapped it, put it into a database, did some simple cleaning and visualized it all on a map. 

I worked with ES6 Javascript, Leaflet/Mapbox, SASS and Webpack for this project.

###__[Foggy Window](http://piratefsh.github.io/foggy-window/public/)__

You know when you're behind a window on a cold day and it fogs up? Yeah, we're replicating that in your browser. So you can have a foggy window in your window.

Used ES6 JavaScript and canvas to simulate a foggy window with Gaussian blur. Implemented smooth line drawing from mouse and touch events.

Project built on Webpack.

###__[Set Solver](https://github.com/piratefsh/set-solver)__

Use OpenCV to detect Set game cards in an image and solve for possible sets. 

How it works:

1. Given an image, identify cards
2. For each card, identify color, shape, texture and number of card
3. Find valid combinations of set cards
