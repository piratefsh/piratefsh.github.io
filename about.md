Hi folks. I'm Sher Minn and I'm a front-end web developer at [Soft Space](http://softspace.com.my) during the day, and co-founder and organizer of [Code Equality](codeequality) during the night. I teach an [intro HTML/CSS class](htmlcss). 

I drink copious amounts of Chinese tea (gungfu-style in tiny cups) and I also like [graphic design](behance). 

I'm currently lacking a portfolio, but you can check out my [Github](github) for some things that I'm working on. Currently unavailable for freelance work, but I'm always excited about teaching opportunities in tech and open source projects for education.

I'm on [Twitter](twitter) a lot.
