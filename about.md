Hi folks. I'm piratefsh!

I'm a software engineer based in NYC. I make generative art and research early computer art history. Sometimes I teach [HTML/CSS and JavaScript classes](http://codeequality.org/2014/06/16/introduction-to-htmlcss.html).

Sometime ago, I was in New York attending the [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com) where I [learned how to be a better programmer](http://piratefsh.github.io/projects/experience/2016/04/16/my-recurse-center-experience.html). I would highly recommend this if you're a self-driven programmer looking to get better at your craft!

Check out my [Github](http://github.com/piratefsh) for some things that I'm working on. I'm also on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/piratefsh) if you wanna be friends.
