Hi folks. I'm Sher Minn!

I'm currently a frontend web engineer building things for [Viki.com](https://viki.com) in sunny Singapore.

I used to be a freelance web developer and co-founder and organizer at [Code Equality](http://codeequality.org) by night. I teach an [intro HTML/CSS class](http://codeequality.org/2014/06/16/introduction-to-htmlcss.html). 

Sometime ago, I was in New York attending the [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com) where I [learned how to be a better programmer](http://piratefsh.github.io/projects/experience/2016/04/16/my-recurse-center-experience.html). I would highly recommend this if you're a self-driven programmer looking to get better at your craft!

I have a perfume obsession and drink copious amounts of Chinese tea.

I'm currently lacking a portfolio, but you can check out my [Github](http://github.com/piratefsh) for some things that I'm working on. I'm always excited about teaching opportunities in tech and open source projects for education.

I'm also on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/piratefsh) a lot.
