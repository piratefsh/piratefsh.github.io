Hi folks. I'm Sher Minn!

I'm currently in the amazing city of New York attending the [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com) where I'm learning how to be a better programmer.

I'm a freelance front-end web developer by day, and co-founder and organizer at [Code Equality](http://codeequality.org) by night. I teach an [intro HTML/CSS class](http://codeequality.org/2014/06/16/introduction-to-htmlcss.html). 

I drink copious amounts of Chinese tea (gungfu-style in tiny cups) and I also like [graphic design](http://behance.net/piratefsh). 

I'm currently lacking a portfolio, but you can check out my [Github](http://github.com/piratefsh) for some things that I'm working on. I'm always excited about teaching opportunities in tech and open source projects for education.

I'm also on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/piratefsh) a lot.
