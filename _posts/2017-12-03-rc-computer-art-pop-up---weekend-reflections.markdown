It's the end of Week 1 of the RC Computer Art Pop-up.

**Thoughts:**

* I'm pretty happy with the things I made this week. I got to sit down and play with some things I've been meaning to.
* Managed to keep to my goal of 'one new thing a day' in addition to blogging and daily comics.
* The reason why I wanted to do 'one a day'
* It's been mostly comfort zone stuff, so working with p5.js to make things that I feel fairly confident I can achieve. While it's been fun, I feel like I can push myself a little bit more to do more challenging or unknown things.
* More challenging things: What would that look like? In my head, it can either be:
  * working with new algorithms
  * learning new technology

**Next week:**

* One of the things I've always wanted to learn is to work in the 3D space. Max Bittker joined us today and showed me some cool stuff you can do with fragment shaders. [Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) was recommended as a good resource so I'll be working through it for the next week.
* Potential distraction: falling back into my comfort zone (which is okay too. Might need a break.)

Art from places in Berlin. Mostly indoors because it's too cold to draw outside.
