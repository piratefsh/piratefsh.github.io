I usually write one of these every year. I skipped 2019 -- it was at a time with too much heartbreak. But let's talk about 2020.

There is the obvious, the dumpster fire of this heck of a year. I'm not gonna cover it, you already know.

Let's talk about the less obvious goings-on.

## Shedding identities

I wonder why I was so desperate to fit into the tech crowd? To be a cool girl who drinks beer and uses vim?

I'll take my HTML/CSS to go, thanks.

I was born to make art with my hands, this is all I know is true.

## Pursuit of Nostalgia

Early and mid quarantine art was full of desire to revisit childhood, the past

> Rather than learn things for the sake of making something pretty or learning something hard, how can we use it to create something representative of our identities. Or using computer art as a way to explore questions/uncertainties/emotions.

I have never managed to achieve this with computer art. I held on to the practice longer than I should have, beacuase it looked cool and was a halfway between my passion and my profession.

The problem with settling for an in-between is that you can never fall into one of the other. Computer art was a way to make something pretty.

I researched the past out of curiosity. But it wasn't my history, and was nothing I could relate to. I turned to my own history instead. But as it turns out, you tend to have a whole host of feelings about your own history, and making art out of it requires you to untangle those emotions.

## Finding beauty amidst adversity

I take comfort in the mundane, in the everyday. Finding tokens of familiar places.
