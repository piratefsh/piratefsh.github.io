I got really into ball-jointed dolls at some point, a weird hobby that nobody really understood. After all, what was a 16-year old doing playing with dolls at the cusp of adulthood?

Clothes for dolls are surprisingly expensive, and so I saved for the nice pieces and would tide myself over by sewing tiny clothes for my resin children. Tiny tank tops made from my old tees, pleated skirts lined with the smallest lace, petticoats of gathered gauze meant for curtains, knee-high stay-ups made from human-sized pantyhose, grungy hoodies made from clean socks. I would gladly cut up my unworn clothes to turn them into little outfits they could wear.

At my height, I crocheted a little sundress and matching hat for a doll from the finest white yarn and tiniest crochet needle I could find. It took my a whole day and my fingers hurt so much after, but it was so pretty. I took pictures of my masterpiece our front garden and posted them to Livejournal. My fellow doll-enthusiast friends loved it. I had my people, fellow weird young adults who want nothing but to dress and photograph their 1/4 scale dolls and to share them with the world.

Yarn wasn't a commonplace resource at the time, because again, nobody wore knits in a land where it was always summer. I got mine from a dimly lit electronics mall, where a yarn supply store was nestled among video and audio stores. Rolls of cheap, synthetic Minlon would line a wall, right next to the good stuff, thick fluffy woolen balls, all imported, of course.


It has been years since I last held a knitting needle. I can't help but think about how nice it would to make myself something warm, or maybe even make it for someone I cared about. My hobbies have a way of slipping away without me noticing. I'm convinced that my fingers still know how to loop yarn around the needle by muscle memory, but I'm not convinced that I still know how to read the notation.

The thing about making things with your hands is like

Realization that computer art will not fill that void, because it is still computer programming. At the core of it, it is still the arranging of instructions. The appeal of which comes from the computer doing unexpected things.

## on making generative art

Computers make for very cold material for art -- it is intangible -- perlin noise, space-walking algorithms, random number generators, mathematical concepts. It doesn't have the same tactility as things of this world.

What is miss is being able to hold material in my hands, manipulate it, seeing it interact with my body and surroundings. I want to inhabit it, adorn myself with it, to get lost in its sensations. Maybe that's why I am so in love with metalworking for making jewelry. It is the perfect intersection of aesthetics and adornment that drives me crazy. Or in other words, wearable art.

Digital material doesn't do the same for me and I keep on wondering why. It can only inhabit the sense of sight and sound, and maybe thats not enough. The sense of touch, smell and taste are left barren, untouched, unstimulated. In my early 20s as programming became a part of my identity, I filled them with tea, perfume and sex, easy ways to lose myself in the hedonism of the senses.

What joy is there in making something beautiful to only store it in a folder of SVGs on your Desktop? I want nothing more than to interact with my art, to inhabit the same space that it does. Would I maybe feel differently about my work if I projected it in a gallery room? Or in a VR chamber? What if I also added scent to the ventilation and had tiny robots tickle you? How much immersion is enough to make me forget that what I am experiencing lies behind a metal box?

Making digital art feels like maintaining a long-distance relationship, an experience I struggled with. It doesn't matter how many times we talked over the phone or Skype, it was just a mere simulation of a relationship, thin and watered down compared to the full-bodied reality when we were together.
