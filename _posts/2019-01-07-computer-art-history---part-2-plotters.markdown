*plotters*.

More specifically, mechanical pen plotters. You can think of a mechanical plotter as a drawing robot. It holds a pen and can move accross a paper surface on a x/y axis. There is another type of plotter common in that era, the microfilm, or electronic plotter that works in a similar way but outputs microfilm. More on that later.

My personal fascination with plotters comes from watching it in action. If you look up media posts on Twitter for [#plottertwitter](https://twitter.com/search?f=videos&vertical=default&q=%23plottertwitter&src=typd), you will be rewarded with many delightfully hyponotic videos of plotters in action. As of early 2019, most of the plotters featured are the Axidraw by EMSL.

I had never seen a plotter until #plottertwitter, and only in the context of generative art. I had assumed that it was what people had used it for, but it wasn't until I was talking to my dad (who is an engineer) and he went, "plotter? What do you need a plotter for? We use it for drawing blueprints". As it turns out, plotters were created with the intent of scientific and mathematical applications.

In this promotional video for Calcomp plotters in 1968, some applications that they mention are meteorology, atomic physics, medical research, oceanography, astronomy, highway engineering (?) and so on.


## Why this fascination

Why is it in 2019 we are still fascinated by this old-school drawing robot?

Everyone I know who has seen a plotter at work or seen videos of it have absolutely loved watching it, even for a few moment. I'm wondering if it's just the pure novelty of it -- most of us born after the 1960s probably have not encountered a plotter in our everyday lives.

I think part of the novelty comes from the fact that our default output device is the LCD screen and we have come to rely on other forms of output less and less. Some 15 years ago when I was still in high school, paper was still really my default mode of output -- we had a risograph machine, the preferred machine for high-volume photocopying e.g. for exercise and exam sheets, which only printed in black and white on a grey-ish brown newsprint paper. At least I think it was a risograph machine. Teachers would call the verb "riso", as in, "hey you, bring those papers here so I riso them". It was a term they used even with the more modern photocopiers. Then there was the laser printer, which gave us wonderful color, which I mainly used to print numerous pictures of my favourite Powerpuff Girl.

But now we have tablets, e-ink readers, phones, etc and the need to manifest information on paper has been greatly minimized. It's easy to forget that there was once a time when there wasn't a prevalent default option.

Plotters also offer something different in that it constructs the final output one stroke at a time, giving you a glimpse into the way the graphic was constructed.
