I recently found myself learning the difference between shims and polyfills. I have heard both terms on many occasions, but never felt brave enough to ask people what they are, with much regret. I wished that I had just asked the person who was speaking for clarification. So I tweeted the following: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There&#39;s so much terminology in the JavaScript world. It is totally okay to say: &quot;I don&#39;t know what that is, could you tell me about it?&quot;</p>&mdash; Sher Minn C.

Turns out a lot of people resonated with this, not just for JavaScript, but for programming and life in general too.

Thinking back on the 6 short years I have been programming [^1], there have been so many times where I'd find myself in a technical discussion where my conversational partner would use a word I did not recognize. I would just pretend to understand what they were talking about, nodding away. I don't do that anymore, and it got me thinking about how that changed. So hopefully this would be of help if you (like me) find it difficult to ask questions.

## Psychological safety

Your environment plays a large part in learning how to ask questions.

I recognize part of this as a mix of impostor syndrome and fear of being judged as incompetent. But by not asking, I just missed out on an opportunity to learn something new. Then again, it is not a habit that is easily formed. I was fortunate enough to have built this habit out of attending the Recurse Center, a safe and inclusive programming community with lightweight social rules built in especially to make "I don't know" an okay thing to say. One of the social rules we hold up is **No feigning surprise**. The rules in the [manual](https://www.recurse.com/manual) says it all:

> The first rule means you shouldn't act surprised when people say they don't know something. This applies to both technical things ("What?! I can't believe you don't know what the stack is!") and non-technical things ("You don't know who RMS is?!"). Feigning surprise has absolutely no social or educational benefit: When people feign surprise, it's usually to make them feel better about themselves and others feel worse. And even when that's not the intention, it's almost always the effect. As you've probably already guessed, this rule is tightly coupled to our belief in the importance of people feeling comfortable saying "I don't know" and "I don't understand."

These days, I've been lucky enough to be working in an environment where it is okay to ask questions. Not only is it totally okay, but my colleagues are lovely people who take time to patiently answer my questions. It's also something I try to do for all the new programmers I meet. I've been mentoring new programmers under the RC Start program, and my mentees ask extremely good questions, even if they worry that they might be trivial. As someone who teaches, every question I get is a precious opportunity to spot the missing gaps of knowledge, and to address them for newer students. 

## Better ways of saying "I don't know"

I have a list of other ways of saying "I don't know, tell me more" that you might find more comfortable with.

> "___ is new to me. What is it?"

> "I haven't heard of ___. Can you talk a little more about it?"

> "I'm not familiar with ___. "

Personally, I use a combination of all of them, and have had many helpful responses. 


## Asking your partner if they know of something

On this flip side, when talking to another person, I try to check in with them. For example, while talking about a particularly jargon-y part of JavaScript, I try to check in by asking:

> "Are you familiar with ___?" 

This opens up conversation about how much they already know about the topic


> "Have you heard of ___? It's relatively new" 

Mention if something is new, so they don't have to feel like they should know about it already. Things move so fast in JavaScript that it's not uncommon to find catching up difficult


> "Would you like me to talk more about ___?" 

Instead of putting the ball in their court to ask for details, offer instead

I find that choice of words matter. Asking **"do you know about __?"** or **"you hear of __, right?"** makes it sound as though your conversation partner is expected to know about the thing and makes it a little harder for them to ask for clarification.
