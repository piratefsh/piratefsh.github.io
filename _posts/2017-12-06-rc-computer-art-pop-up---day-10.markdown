Quick one because today was a very busy day.

Printed some of my work out. I combined the glyphs from day 8 and parametric equation gradients from day 2 to make postcards which read `Recurse Center + School of MA`. The printer cartridge was running out of ink and it caused a really cool glitchy effect.

It was a nice reminder that variation doesn't just have to come from `Math.random()`. Me two weeks ago would have probably been unhappy with the imperfections, but seeing the cool stuff that people at the pop-up are doing with glitch art has made me appreciate the effect.

This was how they were supposed to look like:

Designed some posters for a mini exhibition that will happen end of the week where we showcase our work! I won't be there sadly because I have a wedding to catch, but my stuff will be there!

With what little time left for code, I toyed around with silly eye-swapping.

_ayyy_

Really wishing I have time to sit down and write a more introspective blog post, but that can come later. In the meantime, [Veit Heller](http://blog.veitheller.de/RC_Popup,_Drawings.html), [Max Bittker](https://maxbittker.github.io/rc-art-pop-up-webcams/) and [Vanessa Pyne](http://vipyne.tumblr.com/post/168237961045/rc-pop-up-berlin-02) have been writing wonderful blog posts about their relationships with their tech and art.

To-do:

* create FB event for the mini exhibition /
* make poster variations and print them /
* make a RC <3 School of MA token /
* print out descriptions /

Tomorrow is my final day at the pop-up. It's going to be hard to say goodbye.
