I've been posting my art online for 10 years now, starting with Deviantart. I dug through all of my art accounts to assemble this collection of self-portraits posted since then.

Materials use range from ink to pastels to watercolor to digital art. I realized this is probably not a good representation of my art in general, but interesting nonetheless.

* **2007**: Still very manga-inspired style. Started digital art. Lots of dodging and burning. Graduated secondary school and wanted to go to art school. Art was life.
* **2008**: Got into marker pens. Learned Matlab from my dad and decided to major in Computer Science.
* **2009**: Did a lot more mixed media and digital art.
* **2010**: Colored pencils and [Artist Trading Cards](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Artist_trading_cards) (ATC) phase. ATCs are baseball card-sized pieces of art that you trade with other artists worldwide.
* **2011**: Started doing vector art and graphic design part-time on campus.
* **2012**: Polished up on digital art. Got better at Photoshop and Illustrator.
* **2013**: This was a really good year for art. Got pretty good at using the tablet at work to create vector art. Experimented with self-referential comics. Graduated college.
* **2014**: Lost a lot of momentum when I started working full time at a job I did not love.
* **2015 - 2016**: I did very little art during this time. Somehow, this makes me really sad. In a way I lost an important part of who I was.
* **2017**: I'm making a comeback. [Inktober 2017](http://mrjakeparker.com/inktober) has been a good start.
