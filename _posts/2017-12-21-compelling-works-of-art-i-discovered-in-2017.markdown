Or more accurately titled, 'things that made me cry in 2017'.

### Read

* __[The Husband Stitch](https://granta.com/the-husband-stitch/) by Carmen Maria Machado, 2014__ and this [accompanying article](https://electricliterature.com/what-i-dont-tell-my-students-about-the-husband-stitch-690899157394) - we give and we give, when will it be enough?

* __[The Resident Tourist](https://www.drearyweary.com/tourist/) series by Troy Chin, 2007-2017__ - made me a) want to draw again and b) realize I can tell stories from my own experiences.

* __[The Door In The Kitchen](http://www.terror-town.com/stories/4) by Abby Howard, 2017__ - a terrifyingly apt metaphor for how I deal with difficult issues.

* __[Fun Home](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26135825-fun-home) by Alison Bechdel, 2006__ - my words cannot do this tragicomic justice. incredibly moving.

### Seen

* __[She Represents (Carnival Scene)](https://theartstack.com/artist/jeanne-mammen/she-represents-1927) by Jeanne Mammen, 1927__ - she captures the essences of her subjects so well.

* __That one Mark Rothko piece in SF MoMA__, the one with a red and black gradient - no words necessary. just a meaningful moment.

* __[Still Life](/assets/images/learnings/still-life.jpg) by Tchang Ju Chi, 1930s at National Gallery of Singapore__ - gave me appreciation for Southeast Asian objects as subjects


### Experienced

* __[Untitled (Perfect Lovers)](http://www.theartstory.org/artist-gonzalez-torres-felix-artworks.htm) by Felix Gonzalez-Torres, 1987-1990__ - gave me awareness that context and history cannot be separate from a piece of work.

* __[Untitled](/assets/images/learnings/beautiful1.jpg) [(Beautiful, in conjuction with Loise Lawler)](/assets/images/learnings/beautiful2.jpg), by Flex Gonzalez-Torres, 1990__ at New York MoMA - I felt like a thief taking a piece out of the museum.

* __Rei Kawakubo's [retrospective](https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2017/rei-kawakubo) at The Met, 1980-2017__ - because there is beauty in the weird and grotesque.


### Heard

* __[On Saturday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OryngHKUjY) by Ben Zaidi, 2016__ - a deeply personal piece about a loved one now gone.

* __[Sleepover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6jxPFtIAnw) by Hayley Kiyoko, 2017__ - I wish I had this song in my teenage years.

### Ending
with my favorite thing that I made this year, __[a metaphor for many things](/assets/images/art/metaphor.jpg)__.
