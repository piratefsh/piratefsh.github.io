I'm writing a series of blog posts on computer art history from the 1950s onwards. In this installment we'll talk about __some of the earliest generative art__ made before computers.

This part can be read on it's own, but to start from the top, here's a list so far:
1. [Part 1: Computer Graphics](/2019/01/07/computer-art-history-part-1.html).
2. [Part 2: Plotters](/2019/01/07/computer-art-history-part-2.html).
2. Part 3: Before computers, there was electronic art (you're here).

One of the earliest generative artists was a draftsman by the name of Ben F. Laposky. As early as the 1950s, he created a series of works called 'Oscillons' or 'Electronic Abstractions'. They were debuted in 1952 at the Sanford Museum in Cherokee, Iowa, where Laposky was born and lived. Using a cathode ray oscilloscope, he would combine various waveforms to create hypnotic, gyrating patterns on its tiny screen.

Laposky would combine various oscillators, both common and custom built, in order to generate these various patterns. The parametrization of inputs to the oscilloscope while deliberate, can be considered generative. Sounds deceptively simple, but in fact, Laposky was known to use at least 37 different electronic instruments to create his series of oscillons [^2]. Not to mention the added element of curation by the artist himself. There were at least 6000 photographed oscillons in total but only some 56 chosen ones get to see the light of day, having passed the judgment of some criteria only known to the artist himself.

To capture these oscillons from the screen, he would photograph them with high speed film. What we see in print is not necessarily the whole of it, but just a snapshot of a movement across the oscilloscope screen. Colors where added via colored filters during photographing.

Note that while this technically does not qualify as 'computer art' as a computer was not involved in the process of creation, I chose to cover Laposky's work as its influence is seen in latter-day computer art. The appeal of his oscillons is still very much alive today -- they are very popular and elicit expressions of wonder whenever I would show them to my friends.

My initial reaction to them was that of wonder, how were they made? Knowing that they can be decomposed to structured mathematical waves really got my goat. How delightful is it that we can take simple concepts and combine them in ways that reveal such complex, organic patterns?

It is worth noting that Laposky is not the first to discover the aesthetics of waveforms. The beauty of mathematics is not alien to us[^3]. Lissajous figures, for example, have been known to humankind for their appealing, harmonizing aesthetic. The use of Lissajous-like figures can be seen in some of Laposky's oscillons. In fact, one of the earliest mention of using an oscilloscope as a design tool was in a 1947 issue of Popular Science, with the eyebrow-raising title of "Even Necktie Designers Can Use Electrons" [^5] which features a television test set. Like Laposky, some General Electric engineers realized that by applying varying voltages on these test sets, patterns are created. It's rather interesting that the recommended application for these designs was for use in textile -- I imagine this was before a time when designs created by electronic signals could be considered art in and of itself.

"The expensive electronic equipment is not within the reach of the average individual. For this reason, the medium is not likely to enjoy popular adaptation, although one day it may prove a useful source of inspiration for professional designers." [^4]

Most of the work that survives only the form of photographs. None of the film is known to have survived, much less the control settings Laposky used to create them [^1].

Around the same time in 1955, an Austrian scientist and author, Herbert W. Franke also started making graphics with an oscilloscope and camera. He named his series "Oscillograms". Unlike Laposky, Franke used an analogue computer system built by an Austrian physicist, Franz Raimann that allowed for basic computing operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc) [^6].

Franke is most known to me by his book Computer Graphics, Computer Art, which has captured the zeigeist of the computer art scene in the 60s. Elektronische Graphik exhibition - control constructed by Franz Raimann.
- sine curves, sawtooth - Siemens demonstration model
- not produced as still pictures but as events. two phases of such event.
