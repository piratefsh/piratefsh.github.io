I'm writing a series of blog posts on computer art history from the 1960s onwards. In this installment we'll talk about __CRT displays__, or early display devices.

This part can be read on it's own, but to start from the top, here's a list so far:
1. [Part 1: Computer Graphics](/2019/01/07/computer-art-history-part-1.html).
2. [Part 2: Plotters](/2019/01/07/computer-art-history-part-2.html).
2. Part 3: CRT Displays (you're here).

While talking about CRTs may not sound very interesting, some of the earliest computer artists made use of them to create unique work.

One of the earliest generative artists was a draftsman by the name of Ben F. Laposky. As early as the 1950s, he created a series of works called 'Oscillons' or 'Electronic Abstractions'. Using a cathode ray oscilloscope, he would combime various waveforms to create hypnotic, gyrating patterns on its tiny screen. To capture these works, he would photograph them with high speed film, so what we see is not necessarily the whole of it, but just a snapshot of a waves movement across the oscilloscope.

Most of the work that survives only the form of photographs. None of the film is known to have survived, much less the control settings he used to create them [^1].

To add color, Laposky would use color filters while they were photograph.

Sounds deceptively easy to achieve, but Laposky was known to use at least 37 different electronic instruments to create his series of oscillons [^2].

Inspired by music waveforms. This was the era of electronic music by Moog

Showed in 14 different musuems in 1953-1954. Of considerable interest to the public.
