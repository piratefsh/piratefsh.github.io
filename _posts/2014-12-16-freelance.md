I'm currently available for freelance projects, particularly front-end web development. I do anything from __one-page websites__ to __Wordpress__ sites to __AngularJS__ apps. I work a lot with __HTML5/CSS3__ and __Javascript__, and particularly enjoy developing Javascript features and UI/UX work. 

I work a lot with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and some [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). All of my work is responsive and mobile-friendly by default. 


Some mini-sites that I have worked on from design to development are:

* __[Code Equality](http://codeequality.org)__ - <small>Website for a coding education non-profit I help run. Built on Jekyll and Bootstrap.</small>
* __[Cafehop MY](http://cafehop.my)__ - <small>A project mapping cafes in Malaysia. Built on Angular and Bootstrap. <a href="https://github.com/CafehopMY/cafehopmy.github.io">Github repo</a>.</small>
* __[Fasspay](http://fasspay.com)__ - <small>Corporate site for a mobile payments company. Built Wordpress theme from scratch with SASS, Susy and Breakpoint for responsiveness. Development work only. Worked on [site optimization](/projects/2015/01/23/site-optimizations.html)</small>
* __[Creative Tech Camp](http://creativetechcamp.com)__ - <small>Website for a coding education for children. Built on Jekyll and Bootstrap.</small>
* __[Urbean Cafe](http://urbeankl.github.io/)__ - <small>Website for a local coffeehouse and restaurant. Built on Jekyll.</small>
* __[Malaysian Computing Challenge](http://ioimalaysia.org/)__ - <small>Simple site for a computing challenge for students. Built on Wordpress and Bootstrap.</small> 


I also do graphic [design](http://www.behance.net/piratefsh) work, both standalone graphics and also for the web. 

Do get in touch with me at [sherminn.chong@gmail.com](mailto:sherminn.chong@gmail.com) if you need a front-end web developer for any of the web things mentioned above. I'm also all for working on open-source projects, just let me know :)
