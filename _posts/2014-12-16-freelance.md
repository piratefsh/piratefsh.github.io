I'm currently available for freelance projects, particularly front-end web development. I do anything from __one-page websites__ to __AngularJS__ apps. I work a lot with __HTML5/CSS3__ and __Javascript__, and particularly enjoy developing Javascript features and UI/UX work. 

**Check out my [previous projects](/projects) to get an idea of what I do best.**

Do get in touch with me at [me@piratefsh.net](mailto:me@piratefsh.net) if you need a front-end web developer for any of the web things mentioned above. I'm also all for working on open-source projects, just let me know :)
