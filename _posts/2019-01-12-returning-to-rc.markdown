I recently completed a mini batch the the Recurse Center as a returning alumni. The last time I did a batch was a little over three years ago, in fall of 2015. Here's a little bit about what has changed.

For those of you who are unfamiliar, the Recurse Center is a free, self-directed, educational programming retreat in New York City. You can do a 1-week, 6-week or 12-week batch, depending on what suits you best.

I wrote a FAQ about my experience in [another post](/projects/experience/2016/04/16/my-recurse-center-experience.html). Re-reading it now, I think most of the details still hold true. The cost of living in NYC hasn't changed that much either.

## What has changed?
Going into RC the first time I would still consider myself a junior programmer, not a lot of confidence, foreign, having moved from Malaysia. I spent quite a bit of time in the beginning worrying about fitting in and was often intimidated by more experienced programmers. I can only say this now in retrospect because I felt a huge difference coming in for the mini this time.

Some of the things that existed during my batch but have since been deprecated were mandatory check-ins and residents. I did not miss the lack of residents, as I found them too intimidating to talk to. They were clearly very interesting people and have done cool work, but were presented in such a way that was like, "here is this cool, very experienced person in town for a bit and you should learn from them!". There were plenty of such cool and experienced folks in batch, but having all of us be equals as batchmates made it much easier to go up and say hi.

However, I did miss check-ins, which some alumni in my batch resurrected. I think check-ins help keep me focused and also created opportunites for people to get interested in each others' work.

Going in for the mini batch, I was aware of how short the time is. I did the two-week RC Berlin Computer Art pop-up a year back which gave me an idea of what the experience might be like. I chose a project that I had already done the ground work for and had all the setup I needed. I'd been interested in early computer art history for awhile now - during my batch in 2015, I was introduced to Processing and generative art. Somehow along the way I rabbit-holed down the path of retro computer art, doing a lot of research on it. I had a lot of material at hand, from libraries, scanned PDFs of old periodicals, my own collection of vintage computer art books and so on. I chose the topic in part because I found it interesting, but also because it is not talked about much. Partly inspired by The Art Assignment and Ultimate Fashion History on Youtube where their respective hosts will pick a paprticular movement or artwork and go in depth about it in a rigorous yet accessible manner. Choosing to write on this subject was something that I'd been meaning to do for a long time and had tangible outcome, so it was a safe choice to make.

Writing articles also meant that I did not get as much time to write code. I worked on a couple of small generative art pieces as breaks. Started this whole discussion on vector graphic on Twitter, got started implementing it, but didn't find it very interesting. Then I played a little with Perlin and simplex noise, which was quite delightful.

It was easy to feel a little lonely at first as it seemed like I was the only one who was interested in computer art. Fortunately, my strategy of being more visible by leaving around some of my computer art books paid off -- thanks to people just randomly seeing them around, I met other people in batch who were interested in similar topics.

Overall, it felt like a productive week and I had the pleasure

Things that worked:
- putting myself out there a little more
- having a project with a tangile outcome
- keeping focused, understanding it's ok to say no or to end conversations sooner (gracefully, of course)
