sit in a bright area | [try it yourself](https://piratefsh.github.io/p5js-art/public/eyeseeyou/index.html) | [code](https://github.com/piratefsh/p5js-art/tree/eyeseeyou)

essentially it used face and eye tracking. i'm using a library called [tracking.js](https://trackingjs.com), which has minimal documentation and whose npm package is not a module.
