## Glyphs

Playing with the idea of glyphs and text as input. When handwriting, every character is made out of:

* horizontal/vertical lines
* diagonal lines
* curves
* dots

I mapped each of these features into simplified forms of each. So `A` is made out of two diagonals `\/` and a straight line `-`, whereas `P` is a straight line `|` and a curve, represented as a circle `o`.

It's linear for now but [Max Bittker](https://twitter.com/MaxBittker) showed me [wireLang](https://maxbittker.github.io/wireLang/) and I really want to see if I can do 2 dimensional structure building with 1 dimensional input (e.g. text).

_don't remember what this is but looks cool_

_the word 'glyph'_

## Comfort Zones

I didn't get very far with shaders because I spent too much time on glyphs.

We had one-on-ones with Rachel Uwa and she made a very good point about doing computer art to create something that's a personal expression.

Rather than learn things for the sake of making something pretty or learning something hard, how can we use it to create something representative of our identities. Or using computer art as a way to explore questions/uncertainties/emotions.

## Tomorrow
Continue with shaders in the morning when my brain is fresh, exploratory stuff in the evening.

## Fun things

```
line line line line
