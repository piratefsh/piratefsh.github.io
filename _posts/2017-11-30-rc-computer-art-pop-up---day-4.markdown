### SNEZNT

Continued working on retro computer art piece named SNEZNT from [RecodeProject](http://recodeproject.com/artwork/v3n2untitled-6-Korneder)

Here it my take on it:

Note to self: Added parameters to control the jittering of the grid and other things. Originally built each quadrangle, cell and grid to hold their own colors and fill, but turns out that style doesn't work well when it came to parameterization. All the settings have to be handled by the higher-level grid itself so make it easy to cascade down changes.

Here are some screenshots:

Am going to replicate another small thing today and thinking of maybe trying out glitch art tomorrow.
