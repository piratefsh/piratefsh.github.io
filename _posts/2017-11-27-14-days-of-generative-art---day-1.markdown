title: RC Computer Art Pop-up - Day 1
layout: post
---

Hi friends. Today is the start of the first RC Pop-up in Berlin. The theme is 'computer art'.

I couldn't decide on a big project to work on, so I'm going with the strategy of build one small gen art thing a day.

Today's theme is 'sparkle'. I spotted a lady on the plane playing with her ring that was casting really cool diffractions on the wall.

I tried to recreate that effect using p5.js. The mouse pointer's x and y position control the radius of the light points.

Tomorrow, I'll look into color gradient implementations. I found this explanation on [how gradients are calculated](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39924008) really interesting.
