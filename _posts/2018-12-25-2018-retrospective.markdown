2017 was a [difficult year](/2017/12/27/achievement-vs-fulfillment). In 2018, things got better. Re-reading the 2017 retrospective made me realize that I got better at doing things that I want to, but I still need to work on feeling "not good enough".

It's been a year since I last blogged. Here are some things I've been up to.

## Moved to NYC
I made the move from Singapore to NYC! NYC I think is a better fit for the things I want to do.

Saying goodbye was bittersweet. I built a life in Singapore. I made friends that I miss today.

But it was time to move on. And it was an exciting time.

Brooklyn is my home now. NYC is as gritty and hectic as I remembered it, but I think I've made my home here.

## Started keeping houseplants

I started putting more effort into houseplant care. I used to have a few small ones in Singapore, but I never took proper care of them. Spending some time to research plant care and to be patient with them paid off in the most wonderful ways. There's something fulfilling about caring for another living being.

I drew a short comic about the experience for [Inktober 2018](https://inktober.com/rules/).

For the curious, the maidenhair fern in question is doing quite well now, thank you.

## Experienced many art museums

Being in NYC put me in close proximity with a lot of wonderful art museums. Been thinking a lot about evoking emotion with simple forms, light and colors and of course, computer art.

## Made plotter drawings
Argulably one of the most exciting tools I have had the pleasure of working with, the Axirdraw V3/A3 plotter. Something about watching a work created in the digital realm come to realization i the material world is quite delightful.

## Struggled a bunch
The year wasn't without it's fair share of struggles. I make comics as a way to cope with them. Here are a few:

As per my annual [tradition](/2017/10/12/10-years-of-self-portraits.html), here is my self-portrait of the year.
