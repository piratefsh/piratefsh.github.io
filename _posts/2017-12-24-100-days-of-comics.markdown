Today I complete 100 days of drawing every day. The rules are simple: draw at least one thing a day for 100 days.

It didn't have to be a comic or something great. I just had to put pen to paper. At my worst, all I drew was two rectangles. At my best, I drew a 4-page comics.

On Day 1, I started sketching with colored ballpoint pens.

Part of the challenge was driven by Inktober, a worldwide challenge to draw a thing with ink for the month of October.

I went out and got some brush pens.

From Day 1-14, I drew a series of illustrations

On Day 15 I drew my first comic in years. Something clicked.

Around Day 27 I introduced Copic art markers and fineliners into my arsenal.

Sometime around Day 35 I developed a wrist injury. I drew with my left hand for a few days because I didn't want to break my streak.

Inktober ended but I didn't want to stop.

Around day 40 I drew my first multi-page comic (too personal to share)

On Day 47 I experimented with a more realistic style. It was fun but didn't really stick.

Around then, I also started a series of comics on body image issues. It was the first time I'd ever talk publicly about something so personal.

On Day 64 I introduced watercolors to my comics and drew the Berlin series for two weeks.

On Day 77 I started another series on comics about crushes.

100 feels simultaneously like a lot yet not enough.
