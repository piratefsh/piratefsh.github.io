I drew a comic for each day of my time in Berlin doing the Recurse Center Computer Art pop-up. They were an experiment with watercolored comics.

If you've been following me on social media you might have seen some of them. Here they are in full:

As the days went on, I got a bit better at reusing colors from frame to frame. It's a little hard because my frames are disjointed, sometimes they feature completely unrelated events.

To be fair, I didn't draw all of them on the day itself. I missed day 4 and 9 due to exhaustion but made up for them the day after. It was a good exercise in forgiving myself.

I usually try to keep my comics on the positive side of things, so it was hard to draw about the not so good days (see day 3). At the same time, it isn't fair to paint a portrait of pure positivity when that's not how life goes. I set a rule for myself: if something happened that shaped how my day went, it has to go into the comic, good or bad.
