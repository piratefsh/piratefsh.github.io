I logged my snack intake for a month and made charts out of it.

## Inspiration

Awhile back, I visited the Big Bang Data exhibition at the ArtScience Musuem in Singapore. One of my favorite exhibits there was a collection of postcards sent from one data scientist to another, titled 'Dear Data'. You can see some of Giorgia Lupi and Stefanic Posavec's postcards [in their soon to be published book](http://www.creativeapplications.net/news/dear-data-book-by-giorgia-lupi-stefanie-posavec-now-available-for-pre-order/). They would collect personal data ranging from times they were annoyed in a day to the number of goodbyes said and hand draw charts on postcards to be mailed to each other.

I really liked the idea of collecting data on something seemingly mundane on a day-to-day basis, and decided to start with this: **snacks**.

## Data organization
I organized the types of snacks into three categories, high-guilt, neutral and low guilt (healthy!) snacks. They're relative to how I feel about them, so what might be a low guilt snack may not apply to you. Examples of each follow:

  * <span style='color:red'>high guilt</span>: chocolates, canned drinks, cakes, ice-creams, instant noodles, Krispy Kreme donuts, potato chips, Hello Panda chocolate-filled cookies (omg).
  * <span style='color: goldenrod'> neutral</span>: wheat crackers, bread, sugar-free drinks, coffee, Milo.
  * <span style='color:green'>low guilt</span>: yoghurt, granola bars, fruit juice, milk, dried fruits and nuts

Every time I had a snack, I'll mark it as '1' intake. If I ate two servings of fruit in a day, it will get marked down as '2'. The idea is to track frequency rather than actual amounts of snacks. This went on for a total of 4 weeks. 

Disclaimer: This wasn't done very scientifically by any stretch, but still fun.

## Findings

Here's what I found out:

* I snack an average of 3.5 times a day
* The highest number of times I had a snack in a day was 8 (it was a rough day)
* I tend to snack twice as much on Mondays than I do on any other day (you can tell from the regular spikes)
* I am twice as likely to snack on high guilt snacks than neutral or low guilt ones.
* My snack intake went down as time went on with this project. (I also started eating more low guilt snacks)

## Next
I have a month's worth of financial spending data, which is slightly more complex and fascinating (to myself, at least). More charts may follow!
