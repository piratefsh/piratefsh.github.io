CRT displays wit light pens - allowed for interactive displays
ICL 4100

scale, delete, translate, allows for 3D by variable intensity, TCIN pp, 11-13
can also make tape from CRT display for machining?

Ben Laposky, "superimposition of electrical oscillations of varying time functions" - CGCA pp. 60
- oscillons or electronic abstractions - first exhibited at Sanford Museum in Cherokee, Iowa. add color with rotating color filters in front of display - analog graphics.

Herbert Franke working on similar thing from 1956. Elektronische Graphik exhibition - control constructed by Franz Raimann.
- sine curves, sawtooth - Siemens demonstration model
- not produced as still pictures but as events. two phases of such event.


1960 - Kurd Alsleben

John Whitney 1970s - use camera to record movement. Allowed for interacticity with parametric equations.

CGCA pp. 21 - light graduations is achieved by electron beam switched on and off -- duration of bean on a point determines brightness. typical resolution of 1024x1024 points to 26Kx26k 

- calligraphic displays? pictures as sequences of dots
