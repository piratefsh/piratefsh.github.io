I spent 2 months at the Recurse Center (RC) in NYC last year. I've been meaning to write about the experience itself, and what happened after for awhile now, so here goes! I've also had a lot of similar questions from people who are curious about RC, and so I thought I'd gather the questions and my answers to them in a blog post. 

## What is Recurse Center?
In the words of the RC website:

> The Recurse Center is a free, self-directed, educational 
> retreat for people who want to get better at programming,
> whether they've been coding for three decades or three months.

I would descibe it as a retreat for programmers to go back into learning and exploring. You take time off from work, away from deadlines and the stresses of everyday life. It's kind of like going back to school, but you get to decide what you want to learn, and homework is never boring because you get to choose the cool stuff that you wanna work on. 

Many RC-ers attend it with the intention of bettering their programming skills. You might be a web engineer who wants to dive deep into JavaScript (that was me). Or you might be a new programmer who wants to learn how to build mobile apps. 

RC-ers come from varied backgrounds. During my batch, we had a range of people from academia, fresh university graduates, large tech companies, self-taught programmers, biology, and non-profits. Most RCers are from the US, but we also had a handful of internationals from the UK, Canada, France, Netherlands, Brazil, and Malaysia (guess who?). The diversity is amazing -- I didn't have to worry about fitting in because everyone is different, and there is so much space to just be yourself, which was pretty freakin' amazing.

## Why did you join RC?
I found out about RC in a period of my career when I wasn't growing as much as I wanted to. I was the sole front-end engineer on my team and frequently worked on projects on my own -- the lonely programmer. 

I have a lot to say about being a lonely programmer, but that's for a different story. Back then, I was an AngularJS developer. I could build and prototype apps quickly in Angular, but never really understood how it worked. I never really understood JavaScript, I just knew how to use it.

Being on your own also meant a lot of Googling and Stack Overflow-ing. I had no one to verify that I was doing things the best way. I didn't know if I was growing, or if I was even growing towards the right direction. I wasn't the only programmer at the company, but just because I was surrounded by programmers didn't mean that I worked with them.

I didn't want to become just a developer who was good at churning out projects. Instead, I wanted to really understand the languages and tools I had. I wanted to write good code, and not just code as a means to an end. And what nagged at me the most was the feeling that I wasn't being the best engineer that I could be.

**I was lonely. And RC was a [home for lonely programmers](https://www.recurse.com/blog/1-summer-2012-applications-open).**

The reason why I'm putting all this down in words is because I suspect that I wasn't the only one. If you're reading this and feel the same, know that you are not alone, and there are avenues for you to do what you really want. 

I won't say that I've made it, and that I am finally the engineer that I want to be, but the RC experience gave me the awareness and confidence to grow towards it. The learning never ends. We never graduate.

## FAQ about RC
The RC website has an [excellent FAQ](https://www.recurse.com/faq) on logistical things like dates, cost, and information for internationals, how they're self-funding and many others. I'm including a couple of FAQs here that are specific to my experience that would be helpful to hear for Southeast Asians.

### Is RC for me?

### Wasn't New York City expensive?
Yes, and no. It can be very easily expensive, but in the same part of Manhattan, you can find $3 lunches and dumplings for a dollar. If I had to break it down, my expenses were approximately as follows:

* **Flights** from KUL to JFK = ~$1200
* **Rent**: $1100/mo * 3 months = $3300 
for a fairly nice room a 30 minute subway ride away from SoHo, where RC is
* **Food**: $5-10/day * 3 months * 30 days = $900
I'm probably underestimating this here. Some days called for ice-cream and cookies
* **Transport**: $116/mo * 3 months = ~$350 
for the MTA subway 30-day pass

In total, living necessities probably came up to **$5750** for a 3-month stay. That comes up to MYR22k, or SGD8k.

RC also did offer grants from $500 to $7000 to those who are from underrepresented groups in tech. Read [more about that](https://www.recurse.com/blog/1-summer-2012-applications-open) on the RC blog.
